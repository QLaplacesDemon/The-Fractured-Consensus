"This repository is a subsection of a larger mathematical project. Here, we aim to design and develop a simulation of a diffusion model that represents an entire society of agents, each equipped with its own thinking mechanism. Using this simulation, we will examine and analyze the results and tests derived from the broader mathematical project.
